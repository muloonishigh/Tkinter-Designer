If you want to share your album online or use it for commercial purposes, you might want to optimize it for SEO and HTML formatting. Here are some tips to do that:

- Use keywords in your album title and text captions. Keywords are words or phrases that describe the content of your album and help search engines find it. For example, if your album is about a wedding, you might want to use keywords like "wedding", "bride", "groom", "cake", etc.
- Use meta tags in your web page. Meta tags are snippets of code that provide information about your web page to search engines and browsers. For example, you can use meta tags to specify the title, description, keywords, language, and author of your web page.
- Use alt tags for your images. Alt tags are attributes that provide alternative text for images when they cannot be displayed or accessed by screen readers. For example, you can use alt tags to describe what each photo in your album shows.
- Use responsive design for your web page. Responsive design is a technique that makes your web page adapt to different screen sizes and devices. For example, you can use responsive design to make your web page look good on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
