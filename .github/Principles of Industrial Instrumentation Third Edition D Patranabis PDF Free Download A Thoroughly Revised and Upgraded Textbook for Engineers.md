Industrial instrumentation is the science and art of measuring and controlling physical variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, force, and speed in industrial processes. It is essential for ensuring the quality, efficiency, safety, and reliability of various industrial operations. Industrial instrumentation involves the use of sensors, transducers, signal conditioning, data acquisition, display, recording, and control devices.

One of the most popular and authoritative books on industrial instrumentation is *Principles of Industrial Instrumentation* by D. Patranabis. This book was first published in 1976 and has been revised and updated several times since then. The latest edition is the third edition, which was published in 1979 by Tata McGraw-Hill. This edition covers the latest developments in the field of industrial instrumentation, such as virtual instrumentation, wireless I/O, flow switches, boiler drum measurement, and Clark oxygen analysis. It also includes two new chapters on hazards and safety and metrology.
 
The book is divided into 12 chapters that cover the following topics:
 
- Introduction to industrial instrumentation
- Measurement of displacement and strain
- Measurement of force and torque
- Measurement of pressure
- Measurement of temperature
- Measurement of flow
- Measurement of level
- Measurement of viscosity and humidity
- Measurement of pH and conductivity
- Hazards and safety
- Metrology
- Data acquisition and display systems

The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with ample examples, diagrams, tables, and solved problems. It also provides review questions and exercises at the end of each chapter. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of engineering, as well as professionals working in the field of industrial instrumentation.
 
The book can be downloaded for free from various online sources, such as Google Books[^1^] [^2^] or OpenSea[^3^]. However, it is recommended to buy a hard copy or an e-book from a reputable publisher or seller to support the author and ensure the quality and authenticity of the content.

Industrial instrumentation has a wide range of applications in various sectors, such as chemical, petrochemical, oil and gas, power, water and wastewater, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, pulp and paper, cement, mining, and metal. Some of the common applications are:

- Monitoring and controlling the pressure, temperature, flow, and level of fluids and gases in pipes, tanks, reactors, boilers, furnaces, and other equipment.
- Measuring and regulating the force, torque, speed, vibration, and displacement of motors, pumps, compressors, turbines, conveyors, crushers, and other machines.
- Detecting and preventing leaks, spills, overflows, blockages, corrosion, erosion, wear, and damage in pipelines and vessels.
- Ensuring the quality and consistency of products by analyzing the composition, concentration, pH, conductivity, viscosity, humidity, density, and other properties of raw materials and final products.
- Optimizing the energy consumption and efficiency of processes by measuring the power input and output of electrical devices and systems.
- Enhancing the safety and security of personnel and facilities by detecting and alerting hazardous conditions such as fire, smoke, gas, radiation, explosion, intrusion, etc.

Industrial instrumentation can also be integrated with automation and control systems to enable remote monitoring and operation of processes. This can improve the productivity and performance of processes by reducing human errors and intervention. It can also provide data logging and analysis for process optimization and troubleshooting. One of the leading providers of industrial instrumentation solutions is Siemens, which offers a comprehensive portfolio of intelligent instruments for various applications.
