Note that this theme is not related to the [Firefox for Windows 8 Touch](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox_Metro_UI) project, which was an attempt to create a version of Firefox that would run on the Windows 8 Metro mode. This project was discontinued in 2014 due to low user demand and technical challenges. The Metro UI theme is just a cosmetic change that does not affect the functionality or performance of Firefox.
