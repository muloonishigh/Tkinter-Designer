## Tips and Tricks for Switching Items
 
Switching items can be a fun and rewarding way to improve your character in Metin2. However, it can also be frustrating and costly if you don't know what you are doing. Here are some tips and tricks to help you switch items more effectively:

- Save your game before switching. Switching items can sometimes fail or result in unwanted bonuses. To avoid losing your item or wasting your resources, make sure you save your game before switching and reload it if something goes wrong.
- Use items with high durability. Switching items consumes durability, which means you can only switch an item a limited number of times before it breaks. To maximize your chances of getting the bonus you want, use items with high durability or repair them before switching.
- Use items with low level requirements. Switching items also consumes yang, the currency in Metin2. The higher the level requirement of the item, the more yang it costs to switch. To save money, use items with low level requirements or sell them after switching.
- Use items with fewer bonuses. Switching items randomly changes one of the bonuses on the item. The more bonuses the item has, the less likely it is to change the bonus you want. To increase your chances of getting the bonus you want, use items with fewer bonuses or remove them before switching.
