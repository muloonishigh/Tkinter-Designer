# Edison 5: A Multimedia Lab for Exploring Electronics and Electricity
 
If you are interested in learning about electronics and electricity, you may want to check out Edison 5, a unique new learning environment that lets you create, test, and safely repair circuits using multimedia screens, virtual instruments, sound, and animation. Edison 5 is a software program that simulates real-time 3D graphics and lifelike 3D components that will captivate you as you build circuits in the real 3D world[^1^].

Edison 5 comes with over 100 experiments and problems that you can use immediately or modify to suit your needs. You can select realistic batteries, resistors, diodes, LEDs, transistors, logic gates, flip-flops, and even microcontrollers and integrated circuits from the shelves of your multimedia lab. You can drag them onto your "breadboard" and wire them together with your mouse. Your circuit begins working immediately, so you can test and troubleshoot it with virtual instruments such as oscilloscope, multimeter, signal generator, and logic analyzer[^2^].
 
In addition, Edison 5 automatically prepares a standard schematic diagram and displays it simultaneously with your circuit. You can also use Edison 5's schematic editor and circuit analyzer, compatible with the more advanced TINA circuit analysis program. Edison 5 provides a state-of-the-art analysis results window in addition to its virtual instruments. You can present circuit analyses with full control over axes, line style, color and fonts. You can even print these diagrams directly from Edison 5 or cut and paste them into your favorite word processor[^3^].
 
One of the most intriguing and innovative features of Edison 5 is that it can not only calculate voltages and currents, but also, for linear circuits, show how these results are derived or mathematically described. For example, you can learn how to use Ohm's law, how the output of a filter varies with frequency, and how the voltage of a charging capacitor varies as a function of time[^2^].
 
Edison 5 also supports mixed circuit simulation, allowing you to mix analog parts with any digital parts including microcontrollers. You can choose from PIC, AVR and 8085 microcontrollers and program them using assembly language or flowcharts. You can also use mechanical parts such as gears, worms, racks, pulleys and more to create interactive models of machines[^4^].
 
Edison 5 is a powerful and fun tool for learning about electronics and electricity. You can download a demo version from the official website or order the full version online. Whether you are a teacher, a student, or a hobbyist, you will find Edison 5 to be an engaging and educational experience.
  
Edison 5 is not only a learning environment, but also a creative one. You can design your own circuits and experiments using the components and instruments available in the multimedia lab. You can also share your work with others by exporting your circuits as images or videos. You can even create your own interactive tutorials and quizzes using the built-in authoring tools.
