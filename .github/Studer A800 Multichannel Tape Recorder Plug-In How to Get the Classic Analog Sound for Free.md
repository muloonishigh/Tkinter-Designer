However, this plug-in is not cheap. It costs $349 at the official Universal Audio website, and you also need a UAD-2 or Apollo hardware device to run it. If you don't have the budget or the hardware for this plug-in, don't worry. There is a way to get it for free, legally and safely. Here's how:
 
1. Download the UAD Spark app from [https://www.uaudio.com/spark](https://www.uaudio.com/spark). This is a free app that lets you try out various UAD plug-ins for 14 days, without any hardware or payment required.
2. Launch the UAD Spark app and create an account or log in with your existing UA account.
3. Go to the Plug-Ins tab and find the Studer A800 Multichannel Tape Recorder Plug-In. Click on the Try button to activate your 14-day trial.
4. Open your DAW of choice and load the Studer A800 plug-in on your tracks. You can use it as an insert effect or as a send/return effect. You can also use it as a LUNA extension if you are using UA's own DAW.
5. Enjoy the rich analog sound of the Studer A800 plug-in for free for 14 days. You can use it on as many tracks and projects as you want during this period.

That's it. You have just saved yourself $349 and got access to one of the best tape emulation plug-ins on the market. Of course, this is only a temporary solution. If you want to keep using the Studer A800 plug-in after the trial period expires, you will have to buy it from UA and get a compatible hardware device.
