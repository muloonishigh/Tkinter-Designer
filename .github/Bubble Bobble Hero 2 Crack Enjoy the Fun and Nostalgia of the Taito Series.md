If you want to play Bubble Bobble Hero 2 on your PC, you will need to download a crack file that bypasses the copy protection of the game. The crack file can be found on various websites, such as Archive.org[^2^] or Praxis Benefits[^4^]. However, be careful when downloading files from unknown sources, as they may contain viruses or malware.
 
Once you have downloaded the crack file, you will need to extract it to the same folder where you installed the game. You can install the game from Old Games Download[^1^], which provides a zip file that contains the game files. You will need to unzip the file and run the setup.exe file to install the game. By default, the game will be installed in C:\Program Files\GameLibrary\BUBBLE BOBBLE HERO2.
 
After installing the game and extracting the crack file, you can run the BBH2.exe file to start playing. You can also create a shortcut of the file on your desktop for easier access. The game supports keyboard and joystick controls, and you can adjust the settings from the options menu. You can also play with a friend in co-op mode by selecting two players from the main menu.
 
Bubble Bobble Hero 2 is a fun and nostalgic game that will appeal to fans of the original arcade game. It has colorful graphics, catchy music, and challenging levels. However, it is not an official sequel and may have some bugs or glitches. Also, downloading and using a crack file may be illegal in some countries, so do it at your own risk.
  
If you are curious about how Bubble Bobble Hero 2 looks and plays, you can watch some gameplay videos on YouTube. For example, you can check out the videos by 10min Gameplay[^1^] or Squakenet[^2^], which show the first few levels of the game. You can see how the game has improved graphics and sound effects compared to the original, as well as new enemies and items.
 
One of the most notable features of Bubble Bobble Hero 2 is the ability to choose from four different characters: Bubblun, Bobblun, Kululun, and Cororon. Each character has a different color and a different special bubble that can be activated by holding down the fire button. For example, Bubblun's special bubble is a lightning bubble that can zap enemies horizontally, while Kululun's special bubble is a water bubble that can wash away enemies vertically.
